## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge is to build the Coming Soon website and make it look as close to the proposed design as possible.

You can use any tool you want to complete the challenge. If you have something you would like to practice, feel free to do so.

Users should be able to:

- See the optimal layout of the website depending on the size of the device.
- See the hover states for each interactive element

## Where to find everything

The challenge task is to build the website with the designs inside the `/design` folder. Inside you will find both mobile and desktop versions to work with.

The designs are static JPG files. This means that you will have to use your criteria for styles like `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacing and size.

You will find all the necessary assets in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which has the information you will need, such as color palette and fonts.



**Have fun programming!
